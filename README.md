Student Grade Generator:
This program takes student marks as input from the user and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following scale:

A > 79
B > 60 to 79
C > 59 to 49
D > 40 to 49
E > less 40
Speed Detector:
This program takes the speed of a car as input and prints "Ok" if the speed is less than 70 km/s. If the speed is greater than 70 km/s, it calculates the number of demerit points the driver has earned based on the following scale:

For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70 km/s), the driver earns one demerit point.
If the driver earns more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended".
Net Salary Calculator:
This program takes the basic salary and benefits of an employee as input and calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions, and net salary based on the rates provided by KRA, NHIF, and NSSF.

The KRA, NHIF, and NSSF rates used in this program are available at the following links:

To create a quality program, i haveput in a lot of effort to ensure that the code is functional, easy to read and understand, and efficient. I have test the code thoroughly to make sure that it handles all possible inputs and scenarios.
